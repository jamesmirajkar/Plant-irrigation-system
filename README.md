## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed [e.g., Keil MDK, LPC214x library].
3. Build the project using your preferred compiler or integrated development environment.
4. Upload the compiled code to the LPC214x microcontroller.
5. Connect the necessary peripherals and devices [e.g., LCD display, ADC].
6. Power on the system and ensure all connections are correct.

## Usage

1. Power on the system.
2. The program will initialize and set up the peripherals and devices.
3. The LCD display will show relevant messages and information based on the ADC readings.
